Enter length, breadth and height as input. After that we first call the volume method. 
From volume method we call area method and from area method we call perimeter method. 
Hence we get perimeter, area and volume of cuboid as output.


for parimeter use this : 12 * (l + b)
for area use this :      6 * l * b
for volume use this:  l * b * h
